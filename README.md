# Elite Baby 

## Background and Overview
Elite Baby is a platform game which a user controls a baby who runs and jumps onto platforms and objects to collect foods such as milk bottles. Some of these foods will be power ups to help user through the game. User will also avoid enemies such as broccoli. Being caught by an enemy will end the game.
